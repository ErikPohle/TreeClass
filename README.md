# Music Library
Creating a project in Java that uses a Hash Table to add music to a library and be able to give the song a rating, search for a specific song, and add/remove songs.

# Hash Function
The Hash Function has been tricky to trouble shoot and may not be at its most efficient form as of yet. Looking into different techniques of handling collisions so I won't have to rehash every time and can save some space.

# Further Implementation
As of now, running the program prompts the user to add songs via the console. Ideally I want to add a graphics based UI.
